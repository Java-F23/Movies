# What I Changed 
I have edited the code to follow the Model View Controller idealogy, the Model contains all the databases (csv files) that I have used, the view contains all the GUI's and hompages i created and the controller contains that links both of them together. I have also added CSV files instead of storing the data in an ArrayList. I have checked that I have used inhertince and OOP in the project.
